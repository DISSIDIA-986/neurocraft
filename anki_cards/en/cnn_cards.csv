"What is the core idea behind a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?","CNNs are specialized networks for processing grid-like data, like images. Their core idea is to use 'filters' (or kernels) that slide across the input to detect specific features (like edges, corners, or textures), creating 'feature maps.' This is similar to how our own visual cortex recognizes patterns.","CNN"
"What are the two key principles that make CNNs so efficient for images?","1. **Parameter Sharing:** A single filter is used across the entire image, so the network doesn't need to learn separate detectors for the same feature in different locations. 2. **Sparsity of Connections (Local Receptive Fields):** Neurons are only connected to a small, local region of the input, which is efficient and leverages the spatial locality of image data.","CNN"
"What is the purpose of a Pooling layer in a CNN?","Think of a pooling layer as summarizing a neighborhood. It reduces the size of the feature maps (e.g., by taking the maximum value in a 2x2 window), which has two benefits: it reduces the number of parameters and computations, and it makes the feature detection slightly invariant to the exact position of the feature in the image.","CNN"
"How do CNNs learn hierarchical features?","Like building with LEGOs. The first layers learn basic features like simple edges and colors. The next layers combine these edges to form more complex shapes like corners or textures. Deeper layers combine those shapes to recognize object parts (like an eye or a nose), and the final layers recognize entire objects (like a face).","CNN"
"What is a 'feature map' in a CNN?","A feature map is the output of one filter applied across the input image. It's a 2D grid that highlights the locations in the image where the filter's specific feature (e.g., a vertical edge) was detected. A single convolutional layer typically produces many feature maps, one for each filter.","CNN"
