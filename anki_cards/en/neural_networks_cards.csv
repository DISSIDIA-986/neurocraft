"What is a neural network, inspired by the brain?","A neural network is a computational model inspired by the human brain's structure. It consists of interconnected 'neurons' organized in layers. Each neuron receives signals, processes them, and passes them on to other neurons. The network 'learns' by adjusting the strength of these connections (weights) based on data.","NeuralNetworks"
"What are the three main types of layers in a basic neural network?","1. **Input Layer:** Receives the initial raw data (the features of your problem). 2. **Hidden Layers:** The intermediate layers where most of the computation happens. They extract progressively more complex features from the data. 3. **Output Layer:** Produces the final result (e.g., a classification or a predicted value).","NeuralNetworks"
"What is the purpose of a weight in a neural network?","A weight represents the strength and sign (positive or negative) of a connection between two neurons. A higher weight means the signal from one neuron will have a stronger influence on the next. During training, the network learns the optimal values for these weights to solve the task.","NeuralNetworks"
"What is 'Backpropagation' and why is it fundamental to training neural networks?","Backpropagation (or 'backprop') is the algorithm used to train neural networks. After the network makes a prediction (forward pass), backprop calculates the prediction error and propagates this error *backward* through the network, from the output layer to the input layer. This process determines how much each weight contributed to the error, so the network knows how to adjust them to improve.","NeuralNetworks"
"What is a 'loss function' (or cost function)?","A loss function measures how bad the model's prediction was compared to the correct, ground-truth label. It quantifies the 'error' of the model. The entire goal of training is to adjust the model's weights to minimize the value of this loss function.","NeuralNetworks"
