"What is OpenCV?","OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a fundamental and highly optimized library for computer vision tasks. It provides a vast collection of tools and algorithms for real-time image and video processing.","OpenCV"
"How does a computer 'see' an image? How is it represented in OpenCV?","A computer sees an image as a grid of numbers called pixels. In OpenCV, this is represented as a NumPy array. For a grayscale image, it's a 2D array (height x width). For a color image, it's a 3D array (height x width x channels), where the channels are typically Blue, Green, and Red (BGR).","OpenCV"
"What is the purpose of converting an image to grayscale?","Converting to grayscale simplifies the image by reducing it from 3 channels (color) to 1 channel (intensity). This is often done as a pre-processing step because it reduces computational complexity, and for many tasks like edge or feature detection, color information is not necessary.","OpenCV"
"What is image filtering (or convolution) in OpenCV?","It's the process of sliding a small matrix, called a 'kernel,' over an image to achieve a certain effect. This is the foundation of many image processing tasks. For example, using a blurring kernel can reduce noise, while using a sharpening kernel can enhance edges.","OpenCV"
"What is Edge Detection?","Edge detection is a technique used to identify the boundaries of objects within an image. It works by finding points where the image brightness changes sharply. The Canny edge detector is a popular and effective multi-stage algorithm for this task in OpenCV.","OpenCV"
"What is the role of the DNN (Deep Neural Network) module in OpenCV?","The DNN module acts as a bridge to the world of deep learning. It allows you to load and run pre-trained deep learning models (from frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch) directly within an OpenCV application. This is extremely useful for integrating powerful models for tasks like object detection (e.g., YOLO) or classification into a computer vision pipeline.","OpenCV"
"What are Morphological Operations in OpenCV?","They are simple operations performed on binary images to modify the shape of objects. The two most fundamental are: **Erosion**, which shrinks bright regions to remove noise, and **Dilation**, which enlarges bright regions to close gaps.","OpenCV"
