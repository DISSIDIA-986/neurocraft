"When should you choose a classic ML algorithm (like XGBoost) vs. a Deep Learning model?","Use classic ML (like XGBoost or Random Forest) for **structured or tabular data**. They are often faster, easier to interpret, and can achieve top performance. Use Deep Learning (like CNNs or Transformers) for **unstructured data** like images, text, and audio, where they excel at learning complex hierarchical features automatically.","MLFrameworks"
"What is the primary difference between PyTorch and TensorFlow?","Historically, the main difference was **PyTorch's dynamic graph** (more flexible, better for research) vs. **TensorFlow's static graph** (more rigid, better for production). Today, this distinction has blurred as TensorFlow 2.x also uses a dynamic approach by default. The choice often comes down to ecosystem, community preference, and deployment needs.","MLFrameworks"
"What is scikit-learn and what is its role in the ML ecosystem?","Scikit-learn is the go-to library for **classic machine learning** in Python. It provides a unified, simple API for a vast array of algorithms for classification, regression, and clustering (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, K-Means), as well as tools for pre-processing and model evaluation. It is not, however, a deep learning framework.","MLFrameworks"
"What is XGBoost, and why is it so popular for tabular data?","XGBoost is an optimized and highly efficient implementation of the **Gradient Boosting** algorithm. It's popular because it consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance on structured (tabular) data by combining many 'weak' decision tree models into a single, powerful 'strong' model. It's a favorite in data science competitions like Kaggle.","MLFrameworks"
"What is the purpose of the Hugging Face `transformers` library?","The `transformers` library democratizes NLP. It provides a simple, unified interface to download, train, and use thousands of pre-trained Transformer-based models (like BERT, GPT-2, T5). It abstracts away much of the complexity, making it incredibly easy to apply state-of-the-art NLP models to your own tasks.","MLFrameworks"
