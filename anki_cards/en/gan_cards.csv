"What is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)?","A GAN is a clever type of neural network that learns to generate new data. It consists of two competing networks: a **Generator** that tries to create fake data (e.g., images of faces), and a **Discriminator** that tries to spot the fakes. They train together in a 'cat-and-mouse' game.","GAN"
"Use an analogy to explain the GAN training process.","Think of an art forger (the Generator) and an art detective (the Discriminator). The forger creates paintings and tries to pass them off as real. The detective learns to tell the fakes from the real ones. The forger gets feedback from the detective's failures and gets better. The detective gets better by seeing more fakes. This competition forces the forger to eventually create masterpieces that are indistinguishable from the real thing.","GAN"
"What is 'Mode Collapse' in GANs?","Mode collapse is a common failure case where the Generator finds a few 'easy wins'—outputs that can easily fool the Discriminator. It then gets lazy and only produces those few outputs, leading to a severe lack of diversity in the generated samples. For example, a GAN trained on faces might only generate faces with one specific ethnicity or hairstyle.","GAN"
"What is a Conditional GAN (cGAN)?","A standard GAN generates random data. A **Conditional GAN (cGAN)** gives you control over what it generates. By providing an extra piece of information (a 'condition,' like a class label or a text description), you can direct the Generator. For example, you can tell it to 'generate an image of a cat' specifically.","GAN"
"What problem did CycleGAN solve?","CycleGAN solved the problem of **unpaired image-to-image translation**. For example, it can learn to turn horses into zebras without needing before-and-after pictures of the *same* horse becoming a zebra. It does this by learning the general characteristics of the 'horse domain' and the 'zebra domain' and enforcing a 'cycle consistency' loss to ensure the translation is reversible.","GAN"
"Compared to GANs, what are the main pros and cons of Diffusion Models?","**Pros:** Diffusion models are much more stable to train and generally produce higher-quality, more diverse results. **Cons:** They are significantly slower at generating samples because they require a multi-step iterative process, whereas GANs need only one pass through the network.","GAN"
