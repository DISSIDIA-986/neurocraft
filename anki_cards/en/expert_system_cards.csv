"What is an Expert System?","An expert system is a classic AI program designed to mimic the decision-making ability of a human expert in a narrow, specific domain (e.g., medical diagnosis, chemical analysis). It represents the peak of 'Symbolic AI' or 'Good Old-Fashioned AI' (GOFAI).","ExpertSystem"
"What are the two core components of an Expert System?","1. **Knowledge Base:** A database of facts and rules, often in the form of 'IF-THEN' statements, which are painstakingly gathered from human experts. 2. **Inference Engine:** The 'brain' of the system that applies the rules from the knowledge base to the user's query to deduce new information and reach a conclusion.","ExpertSystem"
"What is the main difference between an Expert System and a Machine Learning model?","**Source of Knowledge.** An expert system's intelligence is **explicitly programmed** by humans (as rules). A machine learning model's intelligence is **automatically learned** from data. Expert systems are 'white-box' and explainable, while ML models are often 'black-box.'","ExpertSystem"
"What is the 'Knowledge Acquisition Bottleneck'?","This was the primary challenge that limited the success of expert systems. It refers to the extremely difficult, time-consuming, and expensive process of interviewing human experts to extract their tacit, often intuitive knowledge and formally encode it into a set of programmable rules.","ExpertSystem"
"What is the difference between Forward Chaining and Backward Chaining?","They are two different reasoning strategies for the inference engine. **Forward Chaining (Data-Driven):** Starts with known facts and applies rules to derive new facts until a conclusion is reached. (Facts -> Conclusion). **Backward Chaining (Goal-Driven):** Starts with a hypothesis (a potential conclusion) and works backward to find the facts that support it. (Hypothesis -> Supporting Facts?).","ExpertSystem"
