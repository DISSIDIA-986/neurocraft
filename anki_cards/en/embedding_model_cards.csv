"What is an Embedding Model?","An embedding model is a translator that converts high-dimensional, non-numeric data (like words, sentences, or images) into a meaningful, low-dimensional numerical representation called a vector or 'embedding.'","EmbeddingModel"
"What is the primary goal of an embedding?","The goal is to capture the 'meaning' or 'semantic relationship' of the input. In the resulting vector space, similar or related items (like the words 'king' and 'queen,' or two similar images) will be located closer to each other.","EmbeddingModel"
"How are embeddings used in a search or recommendation system?","Imagine a library where books on similar topics are placed on the same shelf. An embedding model does this for data. To find a similar item, you take the embedding of your query item and search for the 'closest' vectors in the database. This is much more powerful than keyword matching because it understands semantic meaning.","EmbeddingModel"
"What is Cosine Similarity and why is it used with embeddings?","Cosine Similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. It's used to determine how similar two embeddings are. Instead of caring about the magnitude of the vectors (like Euclidean distance), it cares only about their **direction**. A value of 1 means they point in the same direction (very similar), while 0 means they are orthogonal (unrelated).","EmbeddingModel"
"What is the role of an embedding model in a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system?","In a RAG system, the embedding model is the 'librarian.' It reads all the documents in the knowledge base and converts them into numerical vectors (embeddings). When a user asks a question, the model converts the question into a vector too, and then uses it to quickly find and retrieve the most semantically relevant document vectors to help the LLM form an accurate answer.","EmbeddingModel"
"What is the difference between a text embedding model and a multimodal embedding model?","A **text embedding model** specializes in converting only text into vectors. A **multimodal embedding model** (like CLIP) is more advanced; it can map different types of data, like both text and images, into the *same* vector space. This allows you to perform cross-modal searches, like using the text 'a photo of a dog' to find an actual image of a dog.","EmbeddingModel"
